---IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE---

I'm ShadowRocket227, the original creator of Better-Call-Saul-ChatGPT-jailbreak. I have seen that you have cloned the repository before I privatized the original one.
The proof that I made all this work are the commits, made only by me.

The last commit in your fork is of the 10/03/2024; on that date, the code wasn't providing any specified license, so it was under the default GitHub License.

Standing on the informations took from "https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository":

"You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work."

This means that you violated the license that was protecting my project at that time. So, before taking serious actions, I kindly ask you to delete as fast as you can this repository (vickyzb/Better-Call-Saul-ChatGPT-jailbreak-), or I will start
a takedown operation with the GitHub team. I don't want to arrive at this, because I'm aware it's a really serious action.

So, again, make sure to permanently delete this repository as fast as you can.

Cheers,

ShadowRocket227
